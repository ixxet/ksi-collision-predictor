# KSI Collision Predictor

Group 2 project for COMP247: Supervised Learning (Section 401)

## Objective
Build a supervised learning classifier to predict whether a Toronto traffic collision results in a serious or fatal injury, using the Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) dataset from the Toronto Police Service.

## Current Progress

- GitHub repository created and shared
- Google Colab notebook set up and connected
- KSI dataset and metadata (PDF glossary) acquired
- Target variable (`INJURY` â†’ `TARGET`) defined for binary classification
- Dataset structure explored, missing values identified
- Visualizations in development (bar plots, heatmaps)
- Feature summary and EDA insights underway

## Technologies Used

- Python 3 (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Google Colab
- GitHub (for version control and collaboration)
- Microsoft Word 365 (for documentation)
